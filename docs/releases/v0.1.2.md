# sysprims v0.1.2

**Release Date:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Security & CI/CD Maintenance Release

## Summary

Security patch addressing a high-severity vulnerability in CI/CD dependencies, plus infrastructure improvements for release workflow clarity and dependency vulnerability scanning.

## Security

### GHSA-cxww-7g56-2vh6 (High)

**Component:** `actions/download-artifact`
**Fixed:** Updated from `@v4` to `@v4.1.3`

The GitHub Actions `download-artifact` action had a path traversal vulnerability that could allow artifact downloads to write outside the intended directory. This affected our release workflow which downloads build artifacts for signing.

**Impact:** CI/CD pipeline only. No impact on sysprims library code or released binaries.

**Mitigation:** Update to v4.1.3 which includes the fix (available since 2025-09-04).

## Changes

### CI/CD Improvements

- **Release tag variable renamed**: `RELEASE_TAG` → `SYSPRIMS_RELEASE_TAG`
  - Prevents cross-repo confusion when working with multiple repositories
  - Affects: Makefile, RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md

- **Vulnerability scanning**: Added goneat/grype integration for SBOM-based vulnerability detection
  - New: `.goneat/dependencies.yaml` with license policy aligned to ADR-0001
  - Updated: `.goneat/tools.yaml` adds grype to sbom scope
  - Enables `goneat dependencies --vuln` for automated vulnerability scanning

- **Tool versioning**: Updated `GONEAT_VERSION` to v0.5.1
