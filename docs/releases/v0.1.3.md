# sysprims v0.1.3

**Release Date:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Go Bindings Infrastructure Release

## Summary

First fully working Go bindings release. Prebuilt static libraries are now included in release tags, enabling `go get` to work without requiring a Rust toolchain. This release also introduces a manual Go bindings prep workflow and a CI gate to prevent publishing broken releases.

## Highlights

- **Prebuilt Libs in Tags**: Go bindings now ship with static libraries committed to the tagged commit
- **Manual Prep Workflow**: New `go-bindings.yml` workflow builds libs before tagging
- **Release Verification Gate**: CI verifies Go libs present before publishing
- **Dual-Tag Policy**: Both `vX.Y.Z` and `bindings/go/sysprims/vX.Y.Z` tags required for Go module resolution

## Go Bindings (Now Working)

v0.1.1 and v0.1.2 had empty lib directories due to a workflow timing issue. v0.1.3 is the first release where Go bindings work correctly:

```bash
go get github.com/3leaps/sysprims/bindings/go/sysprims@v0.1.3
```

### What Changed

The Go bindings prep is now a manual pre-release step rather than an automatic post-tag action:

1. Run `go-bindings.yml` workflow via GitHub Actions (manual dispatch)
2. Merge the resulting PR containing prebuilt libs
3. Create both tags pointing to the merged commit
4. Push tags; `release.yml` verifies libs are present

This ensures the release tag always includes the prebuilt libraries.

## Changes

### Added

- **Go Bindings Prep Workflow** (`.github/workflows/go-bindings.yml`)
  - Manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger
  - Builds FFI static libs for all 7 platforms
  - Creates PR with libs ready for merge
  - Must complete before tagging

- **Release Verification Gate** (`verify-go-bindings-assets` job)
  - Added to `release.yml`
  - Checks all platform libs exist in tagged commit
  - Fails fast with clear remediation instructions
  - Blocks `publish` job if libs missing

- **Go Submodule Tagging Documentation** (ADR-0012 section 6.1)
  - Documents dual-tag requirement for Go subdirectory modules
  - Updated `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` with dual-tag instructions
  - Updated `docs/guides/language-bindings.md`

### Changed

- Release workflow no longer auto-generates Go bindings PR on tag push
- Removed `update-go-bindings` job from `release.yml`
- Go bindings prep is now explicit manual step

### Fixed

- Go bindings now usable via `go get` (prebuilt libs included)
- Proper semver resolution for Go subdirectory module

### Deferred

- Python bindings (moved to v0.1.4+)
- TypeScript bindings (moved to v0.1.4+)
